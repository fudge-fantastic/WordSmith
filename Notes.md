# Remix
## Directories Guide 
### app: this is where most of our code lives.
- routes/: This folder handles routing in Remix. Any .ts or .tsx file in this folder becomes a route automatically.
- entry.server.tsx / entry.client.tsx: These files manage how Remix handles server and client-side rendering.
- root.tsx: The top-level component that wraps your entire app. This is where you handle document layout, global data loading and global error boundaries.

### **Routes**
### 1. **entry.client.tsx**
This file is responsible for client-side rendering and hydration. Here's what each part does:
- **Purpose**: Once the server sends the HTML to the browser, Remix hydrates the React app on the client-side, making it interactive.
- **Key parts**:
  - `RemixBrowser`: This is the client-side entry point provided by Remix to handle client-side React rendering.
  - `hydrateRoot`: This method takes the server-rendered HTML and makes it interactive with React, enabling the React components on the page.
  - **StrictMode**: Ensures that React's best practices and warnings are enforced in development mode.

**Hydration**: The process of "activating" a static HTML page that was server-rendered with JavaScript so the React app behaves normally.

### 2. **entry.server.tsx**
This file handles server-side rendering (SSR) for your Remix app. It generates the HTML that is sent to the browser.
- **Purpose**: Server-side rendering, handling both bots (for SEO or crawlers) and regular browsers. The server pre-renders the React components into static HTML.
- **Key parts**:
  - **isbot**: This checks if the incoming request comes from a bot (like search engine crawlers). If it is a bot, a fully rendered HTML page is sent; if it's a browser, the page is streamed.
  - **renderToPipeableStream**: This renders the React components to a stream, which allows the server to send parts of the page before it's fully rendered.
  - **PassThrough**: A stream that pipes the HTML response to the browser in chunks.
  - **handleBotRequest**: Optimizes the response for bots by fully rendering the HTML.
  - **handleBrowserRequest**: Streams the HTML for regular browsers, which speeds up the rendering.

**Streaming**: A technique to send part of the page as itâ€™s being rendered, improving the perceived performance for users.

### 3. **root.tsx**
This file is the global layout for your app and contains settings that apply to all routes.
- **Purpose**: Sets up the root layout and includes essential components like meta tags, CSS links, and global UI elements.
- **Key parts**:
  - **LinksFunction**: This defines external resources, like fonts or stylesheets, that are injected into the `<head>`. Here, it's loading a font from Google Fonts.
  - **Layout component**: This wraps all the content of your app, including the meta information, links (stylesheets), and global scripts (like client-side JavaScript files).
  - **Outlet**: This is a placeholder for rendering child routes inside the layout.
  - **ScrollRestoration**: Helps in maintaining scroll positions when navigating between routes, giving a smoother user experience.
  - **Scripts**: This tag ensures that the necessary JavaScript files are loaded in the browser to make the page interactive.

The `root.tsx` file acts as the global wrapper for your app, handling things like global styles, scripts, and overall page layout.

### How They Work Together:
- **Server-Side Rendering** (`entry.server.tsx`) prepares the initial HTML response when a request is made to your app.
- **Client-Side Hydration** (`entry.client.tsx`) takes over after the page is loaded, turning the static HTML into an interactive React app.
- **Global Layout and Styling** (`root.tsx`) defines the layout of your app and injects global assets like fonts and stylesheets.
